This project in it's current state does nothing. If you found this on accident
you shouldn't waste your time trying to build it.

To build:
$ make rpi_arcade_defconfig
$ make

To reconfigure:
$ make (menuconfig/nconfig/xconfig/linux-menuconfig/..)

To update the defconfig:
$ make savedefconfig

So long as you're using rpi_arcade_defconfig, savedefconfig should put it back
in our br2-external dir, so no need to copy it around.

The top level make file does very little, mostly just sets up BR2_EXTERNAL and
passes stuff to Buildroot to do the heavy lifing.
